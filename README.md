  In addition to the original scope of the project, there were many additional tasks and we managed to accomplish a lot. Communication was at the highest level. Even when we encountered obstacles, finding a common solution was not a problem. I am sure that after this project we both had some valuable takeaways. Great job!

  I've been hiring developers for years, but Diogo is by far the best one I've ever worked with. He is always available to talk and always sends updates regarding the project. If all developers were like him, it would make my life much easier.
  
  The code and consistency of all the project were amazing and it really surprised the management with all the suggestions he gave us. The project was delivered 2 days before the deadline.
  
  Will be hiring again for sure!
  
  Thanks Diogo!
